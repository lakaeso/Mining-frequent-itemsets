Main theme of this repo are algorithms for frequent itemset mining. Most important algorithms will be implemented and showcased on relevant datasets (e.g. market basket datasets). Each algorithm's performance will be measured relative to dataset's size.

So far, Apriori algorithm has been implemented.
